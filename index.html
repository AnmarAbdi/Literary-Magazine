            <p>If  you're  reading  this,  then  that  means  you  bought  our  magazine!  In  that  case,  we  just  want  to  say...
                You're  awesome  and  thank  you  so  much  for  contributing  to  Madison  Academic's  first  student-run  literary-arts  magazine!
                <br>
                Working with this diverse team of seniors and juniors has been the greatest joy-ride. When we first started this journey, we weren't sure where to begin.
                 We had so many questions like, “How do we make a magazine? Who do we talk to? Do you think the Times will answer us?” One of the few things we 
                 did know was our theme, Home. We recently moved into our new campus, which was the high-light of our semester. While we loved the feeling of
                  the new campus combined with the fresh air and drinkable water, there were many aspects we missed from the old building. With this big move
                   from our original home to our new home, we dug deeper into what home actually means to each of us. On the cover, you notice the planet Earth 
                   takes the form of a human heart, which symbolizes the prominent phrase “Home is where the heart is.” The world, the continent, the country,
                    the state, the city, all correspond to our meaning of home; however, with-in each contains a different story that composes who we are as individuals.
                     To me, home is where the aroma of freshly rolled flour tortillas and bean tacos in a brown paper bag fill the air. It's where I can hide away
                      from anything and every-thing, and where the background noises are constantly filled with my siblings playing some kind of made-up game or
                       my mom playing Tejano classics. While this is my version of home, The Storybook, is a representation of our members through viewpoints in
                        art and literature. We hope you enjoy this inaugural edition!

            <h2 class="title">My Jackson Home</h2>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; What defines Jackson Tennessee? Is it a college town housing Lane, Lambuth, and
              Union; is it found in the rhythm of Rockabilly music, or in the faces of the 67,000 people who
              call Jackson TN home? For Sandy Fincher, Jackson has been home since 1981 when she first
              arrived in town to attend Union University. For her, Union, and soon the city of Jackson was
              a place to “thrive but wasn't too big to be lost.” Nestled between Nashville and Memphis TN,
              Jackson was the perfect place to have access to city life without the expense of city living and
              became a place where Mrs. Fincher felt safe. For 40 years she has watched the city grow into
              bigger and better things.
              <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; “Over the years, I have seen many things change here. The town has grown in many
              ways; an industry explosion in the late 1980s and early 1990s brought people from all over the
              United States to Jackson.” Prior to this, Jackson had limited industry, but this change introduced companies that produced electric wires, paint guns, and air compressors. “The opportunities were endless” with industry from Procter and Gamble, Delta Faucet Company, Pinnacle Foods, and more. Healthcare and education in Jackson TN would be changing, and West
              Tennessee Healthcare would become the largest employer in the city. The growth of healthcare
              and education services helped Jackson to change from just a manufacturing-based economy
              into a community with a large service-centered economy.
              <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; Another economic boom has been in locally owned businesses. “It is so great to see locals honored in their businesses where they use their intellect and knowledge to display what
              they produce along with their talents.” Mrs. Fincher expressed this when discussing such businesses as the Farmers' Market, Turntable Coffee, Dixie Castle, Light Trap Books, and the multiple local boutiques. Downtown Jackson has welcomed a wide range of locally owned eateries,
              boutiques, cafes, and salons. While Jackson had once been filled with locally owned stores
              downtown, the creation of the Old Hickory Mall shifted the business away from downtown.
              For many years, these buildings were empty. It is exciting to see such growth and the variety
              of stores putting down new roots in this area. The Jackson community preserves the feeling of
              being “local” through their love and admiration for these business owners.
              <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; Education in Jackson has changed drastically in the last four decades. “Shortly before I
              came to Jackson, the county schools and city schools merged into one school district.” This
              made many smaller county schools close and forced the students to move into city schools,
              significantly changing the student body. The school system worked to maintain a balanced
              diverse student body by requiring each school to follow a 50/50 balance between majorities
              and minorities. “This caused a lot of stress on all parents in the school system because children
              were constantly being moved, or redistricting, to a different school.” Some families moved into
              surrounding counties.
              <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; The Jackson-Madison County school system would grow into a place catering to wide
              interest. “We have high schools that are as diverse as the students who attend them.” South
              Side High School is known for its vocational classes and theater programs while Liberty High
              School has an incredible ROTC program along with agricultural classes. Early College High
              allows you to earn your associate degree at the same time you are earning your high school
              diploma. Madison Academic Magnet High School prepares students to face the challenges
              of the best colleges in the country with all honor classes. And the latest addition to the high
              school system is Jackson Central Merry which functions as a medical technology magnet high
              school allowing you to get a head start on a career in the medical field. The expansion of the
              TCAT programs allows many students to enter the workforce as soon as they graduate with a
              marketable skill. Each of these schools helps the students to pursue the educational direction
              that suits everyone.
              <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; Jackson has long been known for its musical influence with the birth of Rockabilly
              music. This was a combination of the new Rock and Roll music coming from Memphis and the
              traditional country music coming from Nashville. Many famous musicians got their start here
              in Jackson and no one more famous than Carl Perkins. Carl had the respect of many rock and
              roll and country artists. Mrs. Fincher reminisced about artists visiting Carl to co-write songs.
              “Everyone would create rumors about who was here but usually it was not until the person
              had left town that a story would be featured in the local paper reporting who had been here.”
              People such as Dolly Parton and Paul McCarthy often visited Carl for several days at a time
              co-writing songs with him.
              <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; For years, people have gone to the Hard Rock Café across the country, but few people
              know the first one in the United States started here in Jackson TN. in the mall. The restaurants
              were already famous in Europe when the two owners decided to compete to see who could
              open a café the quickest in the United States. Isaac Tigrett made a phone call to his mom who
              was developing Old Hickory Mall and within a matter of a few weeks, he had opened his café.
              Mrs. Fincher recalled when it first opened in the mall. “It was a small area near the main entrance. It started as a kiosk with a limited menu and has grown into a nationwide chain.” As
              the restaurants spread across the country, each developed a way to represent the unique history of its area. Jackson paints a place to grow for all desires and pursuits. With the expansion of
              the new arts district, Jackson is going to house many interests. This stretch will flood with color and expression from theatre to murals, and the music that fills the voices of Jackson. Jackson
              cultivates such art from the NED McWether Cultural arts Center, Lights Up! Theatre Co., the
              Carnegie documenting the rhythmic life of Jackson TN., the Ballet Arts, and the murals lining
              the walls of locally owned businesses. Lizzie Emmons with the Public Arts Commission calls
              this home for the arts a designated space “...within the City of Jackson that we are encouraging
              the continued creation of art making and art performing here,” said Lizzie Emmons, with the
              Public Arts Commission. “We are now sparking all of the creative ideas that are going to come
              from the artists and businesses that are already here,”. Jackson has taken leaps into recognizing the talents of neighbors, children, and family through their recognition of the arts.
              Jackson's blossom into a field of interest has opened the doors for people of all backgrounds.
              It has grown to become the home of artists, musicians, doctors, and many more. Diversity in
              Jackson has grown 11% since the 1980s. In response to cultural growth Jackson hosts an annual
              International Food and Arts festival. It allows people to come together, educate themselves,
              experience other cultures, and honor others. It features a parade, music, presentations, food,
              and dance to honor people's ethnicities. “The colors and the comradery are the most beautiful
              sights.” Mrs. Fincher commented. Since the beginning the festival has grown tremendously
              and in prep for the 7th annual IFAF it is exciting to experience the practices that unite us and
              take time to honor those around us.
              <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; So, what defines Jackson? Is it a growing southern town parked in between two big cities, is it an education field that has adapted to the diverse minds of the students, or history in
              the arts? Jackson is a city that has changed much and only has room to grow. “I have watched
              Jackson change from a sleepy little southern town into a larger more diverse town” Mrs. Fincher ends. There are so many new projects expanding our community. Jackson is a place where
              you can find almost anything you are looking for- it's a place you can build a home.
